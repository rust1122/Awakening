## Awakening: AI-Assisted Creativity

A practical introduction to AI-assisted creativity. This repository focuses on methods, workflows, and evaluation—not a full tutorial. Goal: help you quickly build a usable creative workflow and make informed tool choices.

### What You’ll Find
- Creative tracks: text, visuals, audio/video, and code assistance
- Models & services: commercial (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and open-source (Llama, Qwen)
- Workflow methods: prompt patterns, agent collaboration, RAG, semi-automation pipelines
- Practical walkthroughs: brief → creation → refinement → deliverable, with evaluation criteria
- Quality & safety: copyright, bias, transparency, privacy, and anti-abuse principles
- Minimal viable stack: low-friction, cost-effective tools and configurations

### Who It’s For
- Content creators; product/design/engineering practitioners
- Individuals or teams seeking efficiency and quality with AI

### How to Use
- Each topic covers: scenarios, models/tools used, prompt patterns, evaluation and caveats
- Read by topic, or follow the end-to-end flow: need → create → polish → publish
- Examples emphasize generalizable approaches that fit most tool stacks

### Planned Sections
- Foundations: scope and mental models of AI creativity
- Prompt Engineering: structured prompts, role setup, templates and reuse
- Writing: articles, scripts, proposals, and information synthesis
- Visuals: image generation, editing, and video assistance
- Audio & Speech: voice-over, TTS, and music support
- Agents & Automation: multi-agent collaboration, orchestration, triggers
- Data & Retrieval: RAG, private knowledge base setup and maintenance
- Tool Reviews & Stacks: pros/cons and recommended combinations
- Ethics & Compliance: copyright, privacy, transparency practices

### Glossary (Quick)
- Prompt / System Prompt / Templates
- Agent / Tool-Calling
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Fine-tuning / LoRA
- Evaluation (quality, bias, stability)

### Notes
- This file is introduction-only and will be updated iteratively as the repo evolves.
- Primary environment is macOS, but principles are cross-platform.
